Predict NBA games using a Neural Network.
Given the dataset in the format of:

Home Team 1, Home Team result (win/loss), Away Team 1

Home Team 2, Home Team result (win/loss), Away Team 2

Build a Neural network on 80% and make predictions on the remaining 20%.

The code is written in Python3. It uses the numpy and keras libraries that need to be installed (not installed by default).

To run the code, go to the source directory:
python3 Neural_Network.py
 
This will output the accuracy of the NN
